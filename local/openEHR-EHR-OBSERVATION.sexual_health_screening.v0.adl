Common use cases include, but are not limited to:
- Systematic questioning in any consultation; or
- Specific questioning related to infectious disease surveillance.

In order to record the response at a specific point in time or within an interval of time, use the EVENT RM attribute.

This archetype has been designed to be used as a screening tool or to record simple questionnaire-format data for use in situations such as a disease registry. If the screening process identifies a health risk or condition and it is intended that the details are to be recorded and persisted as part of an ongoing health record, any further specific details about the exposure should be recorded using appropriate EVALUATION archetypes.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record details about a specific problem condition identified as part of the questionnaire screening. Use EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis for this purpose.

Not to be used to record persistent details about a risk assessment for a specific health condition, such as HIV. Use EVALUATION.health_risk for this purpose.">

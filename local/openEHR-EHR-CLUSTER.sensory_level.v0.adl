This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination detail' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.exam or the CLUSTER.exam-nervous_system archetype. It can also be nested within any other relevant OBSERVATION or Physical examination-related family of CLUSTER archetypes, where clinically appropriate. 

In clinical scenarios requiring the documentation of the sensory level in more than one modality, use a separate instance of this archetype for each modality.">

In clinical practice and daily use, the terms 'heart beat' and 'pulse' may be used interchangeably, depending on the context and method of measurement. 'Heart beat' is the broader term that covers any method of measuring the heart action, whereas 'pulse' specifically describes measuring the heart action through the palpation of a pulse. When designing templates for scenarios where it can't be anticipated whether specifically 'heart beat' or specifically 'pulse' will be measured, and it's not important to the clinical scenario to tell them apart, the 'Heart beat' archetype should be used.

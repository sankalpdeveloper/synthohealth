The scope of this archetype includes the phases of making preparations for the future pregnancy or actively attempting to conceive, being actively pregnant, or in the period of recovery after delivery.

This archetype has been designed to underpin clinical decision support or exchange use cases:
- To prevent medications being prescribed which may cause harm to an existing pregnancy
- To trigger extra caution in the decision to use imaging in women actively trying to conceive, but not currently known to be pregnant
- To alert pathologists reporting test results that they may need to interpret test results in the context of an ongoing pregnancy or postpartum state.">

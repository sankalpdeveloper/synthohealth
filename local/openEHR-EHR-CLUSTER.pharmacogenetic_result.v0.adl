The primary intended use of this archetype is to support clinical decision making, including digital prescribing decision support, commonly as part of a panel of similar results. It would normally be carried within the CLUSTER.laboratory_analyte_result archetype.

Typically this testing is performed by testing for specific allele variations at a specific gene location, adding derived phenotypic information such as metaboliser status and activity score from which specific therapeutic implications may be drawn.

Although some laboratory reports incorporate those therapeutic recommendations, these are explicitly intended to be carried in separate Genomic therapeutic implication archetype. The principal reason is that those implications will change over time as new research emerges.

A further issue is that each individual result may only cover a partial set of all known testable alleles for a specific gene, which means that the the full genotype and related pharmacogenetic phenotype may need to updated as further testing is done. Discussion is ongoing as to whether that 'cumulative result' is best derived dynamically from existing results , or whether a specific 'cumulative result' should be maintained as a separate record.

The design was heavily influenced by CPIC (http://cpicpgx.org/) guidance on reporting and terminology bindings.

Pharmacogenetic laboratory reporting and messaging is highly variable, but we have taken account of emerging work in this field from the HL7 FHIR Genomics Reporting Implementation Guide.

Pharmacogenetic reporting is generally recognised to be more clinically focused than other areas, such as cancer genomics, which are covered by the openEHR Genomics project archetypes. Through discussions with the primary authors of these archetypes, we have attempted to ensure maximal alignment and identified the appropriate use in the pharmacogenetic context.">

This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination detail' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.exam or the CLUSTER.exam-nervous_system archetype. It can also be nested within any other relevant OBSERVATION or Physical examination-related family of CLUSTER archetypes, where clinically appropriate. 

In clinical scenarios requiring documentation of the sensory responses in more than one area of skin or modality, use a separate instance of this archetype for each area/modality pair tested.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record the sensory response to vibration applied to a bony prominence - use the CLUSTER.vibration_finding for this purpose.

Not to be used to record the most caudal sensory level in response to applying a light touch, pain or temperature stimulus - use the CLUSTER.sensory_level for this purpose.">
